# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.
Tasks 

## Localhost
   
    0. Change your home IP
        Bash script that configures an Ubuntu server as follows:
        localhost resolves to 127.0.0.2
        facebook.com resolves to 8.8.8.8

    1. Show attached IPs
        Bash script that displays all active IPv4 IP's on the machine.

    2. Port listening on localhost
        Bash script that listens on port 98 on localhost.
